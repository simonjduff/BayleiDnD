Iqueral would train the cat in magical arts,\n  and pay a stipend for his upkeep,\n  for which M'Chee-daro would 'acquire'\n  other artefacts as directed by the wizard.\nOver the years M'Chee-daro has come to love Iqueral as a second father. The wizard discovered an ancient tome,  rotting in a backstreet bookshop,\n  that referenced an ancient artefact,\n  lost since the closure of travel to Kinnic.\nThe artefact is the Phlebar's Magic Compass.  It functions like Locate Object,\n  without the distance restriction,\n  and with an vague indication of distance from the object.\n  Once the compass seeks and object,\n  it will point to it until a new object is selected.\n  The object can be changed once per long rest.\nM'Chee-daro has been requested to join the journey to the continent,  ostensibly as an adventurer,\n  but primarily in search of this artefact.\n","Feat":{"Name":"Keen Mind","Skills":["Know where North is","Know hours to sunset/sunrise","Recall things seen/heard in last month"]}}
