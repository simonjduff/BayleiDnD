BackStory:
  From a middle-class background, M'Chee-daro fell in with a bad crowd, and at the age of 8 started stealing for amusement.
  One fateful night, he snuck into a house, seeking something interesting to take. He found a <something magic>, and activated it.
  Unfortunately, the owner of the house was an elven wizard, and the <item> was protected by an alarm spell.
  The wizard returned home, confronting our cat.
  The wizard realized quickly that the cat had activated the artefact, suggesting latent magical (as well as present larcenous) talent.
  They formed a pact. The wizard would train the cat in magical arts, and pay a stipend for his upkeep, for which M'Chee-daro would 'acquire' other artefacts as directed by the wizard.
  Over the years M'Chee-daro has come to love the wizard as a second father.
  M'Chee-daro has been requested to join the journey to the continent, ostensibly as an adventurer, but also in search of a magical item, long since lost, that was referenced in an old tome.
