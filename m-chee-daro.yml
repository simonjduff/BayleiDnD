BackStory: >
  From a middle-class background,
    M'Chee-daro fell in with a bad crowd,
    and at the age of 8 started stealing for amusement.
  One fateful night, he snuck into a house,
    seeking something interesting to take.
    He discovered a black cube in a dresser drawer,
    and when he picked it up,
    swiwling colours manifested on its surfaces.
  Unfortunately,
    the owner of the house was Iqueral,
    a high elven wizard,
    and the cube was protected by an alarm spell.
  With a flash of light,
    Iqueral teleported into the room,
    cast Hold Person,
    and M'Chee-daro was captured.
  Iqueral realized quickly that the cat had activated the cube,
    suggesting latent magical (as well as obvious larcenous) talent.
  They formed a pact.
    Iqueral would train the cat in magical arts,
    and pay a stipend for his upkeep,
    for which M'Chee-daro would 'acquire'
    other artefacts as directed by the wizard.
  Over the years M'Chee-daro has come to love Iqueral as a second father.
  The wizard discovered an ancient tome,
    rotting in a backstreet bookshop,
    that referenced an ancient artefact,
    lost since the closure of travel to Kinnic.
  The artefact's name roughly translates to "Sovereign Orb". 
    The last known location referenced in the tom is the floating city of the magical academies. 
    Its appearance is presumably an orb with arcane runes on it. 
    The translation suggested that the orb had the power to telepport large quantities of matter or people without a circle.
  M'Chee-daro has been requested to join the journey to the continent,
    ostensibly as an adventurer,
    but primarily in search of this artefact.
